    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Razzi's website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>
    <h3>Information we collect</h3>
    <p>New Razzi accounts can be created anonymously via login with Apple, without email addresses or passwords.</p>
    <p>You may optionally add an email address and a password to your account. Email addresses are <strong>only</strong> used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, marketing emails, customer feedback, support, and sending notifications that you request.</p>
    <p>We store any photos that you upload to the app. We also collect anonymous statistics about your location behavior in the app to improve our product and algorithms.</p>
    <h4>Technical basis</h4>
    <p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We may use notifications for marketing.</p>
    <p>If you upload photos to Razzi, we need to store them until you delete them.</p>
    <p>We use tokens in the app to keep you logged in.</p>
    <p>Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.</p>
    <h4>iCloud</h4>
    <p>Razzi stores some of your data in Apple's iCloud service, such as login tokens for your account(s), to enable some sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID.</p>
    <h4>Ads and analytics</h4>
    <p>Razzi's app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.</p>
    <p>Razzi does not allow advertisements on its platform. Razzi may use data collected about you for our own marketing purposes, but we do not share that data with any other marketers.</p>
    <h3>Information usage</h3>
    <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>
    <p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Razzi's functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people are purchasing photos.</p>
    <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>
    <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.</p>
    <h3>Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h3>
    <p>You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Razzi iOS app.</p>
    <p>Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.</p>
    <p>Razzi may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>
    <h3>Third-party links and content</h3>
    <p>Razzi displays links and content for people's personal Instagram accounts and websites. These websites have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>
    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
    <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>
    <h3>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
    <p>We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
    <h3>Information for European Union Customers</h3>
    <p>By using Razzi and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p>
    <h3>International Transfers of Information</h3>
    <p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.</p>
    <h3>Your Consent</h3>
    <p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Contacting Us</h3>
    <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy or if you wish to request account deletion or information deletion, you may email <a href="mailto:hello@razzipics.com">hello@razzipics.com</a>.</p>
